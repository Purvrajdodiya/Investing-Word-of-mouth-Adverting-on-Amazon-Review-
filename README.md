Research Summary
The study found that funny reviews tended to increase purchase intentions and the perceived value of products. This effect was particularly strong for the book, where humor significantly boosted both the desire to purchase and the perceived value of the review.



Grammatical and spelling errors consistently lowered the perceived value of the reviews for both the book and the vacuum cleaner. However, these errors did not significantly impact the participants' intention to purchase either product.




Overall, the study concludes that for text-based products like books, humor can be a powerful tool to influence consumer behavior. While good grammar makes a review seem more valuable, its impact on the final decision to buy may be less critical, especially for utilitarian items like a vacuum cleaner.
